Decide which cities to build cell towers in and lay out the fiber network between cities. There are a few factors to consider:

  1. Each major city in the United States to have access to your network. This means that for each
  city, there must be a cell tower either in that city or in at least one neighboring city.
  
  2. You need to connect the cell towers with fiber cables. Due to government regulations, each city that your fiber
  network passes through must have a cell tower. 
  
  3. When transmitting a signal between two cell towers, the signal must be sent through the fiber cables. Each cell
  tower expects to communicate with every other tower efficiently. When designing the network, we
  minimize the average pairwise distance between cell towers along the fiber cables.
